/**
 * <h1>McCabeâ€™s Cyclomatic Number</h1>
 * <p>
 * CYCLO is defined as "a quantitative measure of the number of linearly
 * independent paths through a program's source code".
 * <p>
 * CYCLO plays a key-role in understanding the overall complexity of code by
 * measuring the complexity of methods. It is calculated as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>if a decision statement is found (for-loop, while-loop, if), 1 must be
 * added to the value of the metric
 * <li>An extra 1 must be added to the final value since the main top path of
 * the method must also be taken into account. This meaning, ZERO is
 * <b>NEVER</b> the CC value of a method that has a body of statements.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Our implementation of CC calculation is responsive to the following set of
 * decision statements:
 * <ul>
 * <li>IF -> simple conditional statement (enclosing only one conditional test)
 * <li>SWITCH CASE -> no matter how many case tests, it adds only 1 to the value
 * <li>FOR and WHILE
 * <li>CATCH -> we understand that the TRY.. block is not an actual path, but
 * the CATCH is since it behaves like an IF
 * <li>CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION -> the ones which are made of more than a single
 * conditional test. The expression is broken down to sub-conditional tests.
 * Each of the resulting tests adds 1 to the value of the metric.
 * </ul>
